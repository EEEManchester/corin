Welcome to Corin's documentation!
===================================

Corin is a hexapod robot built by the University of Manchester for research purposes.
This documentation describes the existing elements of Corin's codebase in order to enable future researchers to make effective use of the platform.

Please bear in mind that this is research code and is thus subject to frequent changes. All maintenance of these docs are by volunteers, and we ask any future researchers using the platform to also do their part to ensure that these docs are up to date with their work.
