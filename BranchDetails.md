# Brief

Used by Wei Cheah for stitching the different motion advanced primitives to produce a continuous motion. Results published in 

    Wei Cheah, Hassan H. Khalili, Simon Watson, Peter Green, Barry Lennox. Continuous Motion for Hexapods using Advanced Motions in Towards Autonomous Robotic Systems, 2019.

This branch is not forward compatible. Hence, the motion plan is exported as a `data.yaml` file and imported by later releases for executing the motion plan.
